# Genp Guides

!!!
This website is just intended for educational purpose and does not promote cracking and patching softwares. 
!!!

This is **unoffical website** made from the wiki at [r/genp].  

**Almost all the written material is taken from the subreddit** and I would like to thank the subreddit wiki maintainers for their awesome efforts in maintaining the wiki.

I have only converted those files to website format and changed the markdown format in some places and changed some content.  

You can suggest changes or corrections to the wiki [here](https://github.com/icantpay/genpguides.github.io).
